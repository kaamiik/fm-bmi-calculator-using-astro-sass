- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility
- Astro

### What I learned

I found this challenge practical even though it wasn’t very complex. Despite its focus on accessibility, it was also challenging in terms of CSS. If I were to do it again, I would definitely use React and Tailwind. The main challenges of this project were ensuring the calculations were done correctly and displayed to the user, and making sure the inputs and radio buttons were accessible and the screen reader worked properly. I would definitely love to get feedback, especially regarding CSS, accessibility, and the project’s JS code.
